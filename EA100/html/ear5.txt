Hello Mr. 
  
  
I'm reaching out to you to confirm that you sent the defective item to our Service Center.  Our system still shows that the item has not yet arrived at our Service Center.   Please reply to this email and confirm whether or not you have sent the defective item to us.  

Please note that it is important that you send your device within 15 days of receipt.  If you do not send in your device in a timely manner, your Complete for Business warranty will not transfer seamlessly and you will have to provide your warranty proof of purchase if ever you call for support on your replacement device.

Should you wish to get in touch with us the meantime you may call me directly, refer to the service request number XXXSR#XXX. 
  
Our opening hours are Monday to Friday 11:00 AM - 8:00 PM Pacific Time. 

Thank you for contacting Microsoft Hardware Support.
